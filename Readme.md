## Predictive Analysis of Lending Club Data using Python 

For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data . Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. I will try to create a model that will help predict this. Lending club had a very interesting year in 2016, so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public. I will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

I will be going over the Lending Club Loan Data. The data has a lot of features, some are useful and some are not, some features have a lot of missing values too. I will try to clean this data and make it ready for a great predictive model.
