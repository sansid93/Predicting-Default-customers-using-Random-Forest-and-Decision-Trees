## Predictive Analysis of Lending Club Data using Python 

• Analyzed the publicly available lending club data from 2007 – 2010 to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full
• Built a classifier using Decision Tree and Random Forest to identify trends and patterns in customer behaviors to accurately predict the whether a new customer will pay back the loan in full or not
